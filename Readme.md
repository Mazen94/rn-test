# React Native template


React Native template is designed to save developers hours of work by structuring of files and folders and installing dependencies to customise their apps
### Dependencies

if you use `Visual Studio Code` as a source-code editor it is better to download these plugins


-  [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
-  [Prettier  Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

if you use another editor check if your editor has these plugins.
